# Design-Patterns-with-Java
Meaningless code of design patterns with Java


///////////////////////

These are programs i wrote while practicing design patterns, I decided to create
a github repository for it, so i can get a quick look before interview or stuffs.
The function names and their purposes won't make any sense. Minimal code is written
here just to showcase how a specific design pattern should be implemented. I'll try to
add comments in the future.
